Meal Web Project
This is a React-based Meal Web project created as part of my learning and practice.

✨ Project Overview
Built using React.js.

Organized into small, meaningful commits, each representing a specific feature or section added to the project.

The goal was to develop the entire project step by step, committing small parts to understand Git workflows clearly.

⚠️ Important Note
🚫 Accidental Build Commit

Initially, I created the entire project at once, but committed it feature by feature with different commit IDs for learning.

Accidentally, I committed the build folder as well.

This build folder is not required in the repository since it can always be generated by:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run build
✔️ Therefore, ignore the build folder in version control.

📁 Project Structure
/src – React source code

/public – Static files

package.json – Project dependencies and scripts

💻 How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <repo-url>
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Run the project:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
🔥 Why This Project?
To practice modular coding by creating each component step by step.

To gain confidence in React development and Git version control.

✅ Future Goals
Continue adding more features (Cart, Meals list, Checkout, etc.) with clear, small commits to maintain clean version history.

Avoid committing build files in the future by adding them to .gitignore.

📌 .gitignore Reminder
Ensure build/ is included in your .gitignore:

Copy
Edit
node_modules/
build/
